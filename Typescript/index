// Javascript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime).
// Typescript uses "static types" (set during development while compiling).

// In TypeScript, you work with types like string or number all the times.
// Important: It is string and number (etc.), NOT String, Number etc.
// The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!
