// Flatten an Array of elements using JS
// First programming question was covert a nested array in a flat list. For Example: Input : [2,3,[8], [[[12]]]] output: [2,3,8,12]
// Design todo list in vanilla js.
// On click of button , create a task queue. each task takes 10s to complete At given time only 3 tasks should be executed
// Progress bar - I need to make a progress bar and one button by clicking of button another progress bar will be shown. We can create as many progress bar as we want but 5 at a time will be working. Rest will be start after the completion of first.
// Round 1- 2 leetcode problems Minimum grid sum - Medium Basic Calculator- Hard



// Mostly on writing polyfill for array.reduce() Promise.all()



// DSA string + sliding window
// problem-solving Javascript questions and a polyfill question


// 1. JavaScript (Closure, Hoisting, Flattening etc) React (lifecycle, hooks) 2. UI and APIs 3. How deep linking work in RN, when application.create called, how to bridge in RN etc.

// Pipe async Promise polyfills Array polyfills Object questions


// Design a JIRA type system.




// What is hoisting, write promise.all polyfills, why promise.all is async, flateern an array , write memo function, React native Animations

// Then object restructuring question. Some concepts check on let, const, var. I gave all the answers and solved all the questions. With minor mistake, which was not to big. As I said, the interviewer was not qualified for taking the interview (i checked his LinkedIn profile) and hence I was rejected. IMO, if there were 2 interviewers then I think, I must have chance for the next round.

// In round 1: - 1 leetcode medium question - How does JVM manage heap memory ? Role of GC ? In round 2: Design Google sheet, where one cell can have value reference of another cell ?


// JavaScript and React basics, with questions around promises, the event loop, closures, etc. Task to implement multiple progress bars and ensure only five run at a time, resuming paused bars as others complete. Chat window that can be attached to any website. Behavioral questions and how processes work in my current company

// 1. Closures and implement it
// 2. Output of this let isFlag = true setTimeout(() => isFlag = false, 10); while (isFlag) { console.log("hello"); }
// 3. Shallow copy and deep copy of objects along with a output question
// 4. Polyfills
// 5. implement a polyfill for array.reduce
// 6. Implement a missing closure function

// I had an interview at Zepto for the first round. The interviewer asked me several questions, including: The use of useMemo and useCallback Whether we can render a screen using useRef They asked me to run this code and explain the output: javascript Copy code (function() { console.log(a); if (true) { var a = 'a'; } console.log(a); console.log(b); const bar = function() { var b = 'b'; console.log(b); }; bar(); console.log(b); })(); They asked about Promises and requested that I write the code for Promise.all as if I were coding before ES6. They asked about Array.reduce and requested that I write code using prototype. Finally, they asked me to explain the difference between Array.filter and Array.map. I honestly answered all the questions, but I made a slight mistake with the code. I donâ€™t know why I was rejected in the first round of the interview; I was expecting to get selected.


// 1. Vanilla js - todo lists 2. make header, body and footer, header should be at top, footer should be at bottom regardless of the screen size. 3. React.memo, useMemo and useCallback difference 4. SSR and CSR 5. Which React js version we are using, what is current version what feature is coming in upcoming react version :)). 6. event bubbling, capturing

// Question 1 questions were based on JS concepts. prototypal inheritance, debounce, throttle, pollyfills etc. react based question (at ending 10 mins) useMemo useCallback,memo, hocs, context and state etc
