Calculations based on assumptions for Scale
Example for Instagram
- 1 million daily active users - 100,0000
- 1 daily post per user / 100 post view per post -> read / write ratio
- 1pm lunch tine, 9pm evening - 70% users active
- 700,000 active users during peak time
- 100 * 700,000 - (8 to 10) - 2hr
- 100 * 700000 / (2 * 60 * 60) = 10k rps (request persecond) - load on server
