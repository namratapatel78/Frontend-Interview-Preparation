// max sum by picking at most k elements from either corner of the array
// Check if reachable from the first row to last row of a 2d matrix

// Parking lot
// tic tac toe

// String related
// Recursion related

// Directed graph-related
// Stack implementation
// BookMyShow design

// One question related to the tweaked binary search.
// One easy question related to DP.
// The circular queue implementation and reverse the sublist of a linked list


// 2 normal DS questions of array and dp
// Design Parking lot

// Round 1: DS Algo - mathematical based question
// Round 2: JS,CSS,Html - basic question related to javascript, closures, polyfills, debouncing, js methods
// Round 3: Framework related - string manipulation, abt vue framework

// Round 1 - One easy and one medium difficulty level DSA question was asked. Shouldn't be a problem if your basics are clear. I was able to answer both way before time.
// Round 2 - I was asked to design the system for one of the products explained by the interviewer. I tried to cover as many use-cases as I could. Try to answer this question by keeping in mind modularisation and SOLID principles.
// Round 3 - Asked questions about projects and the programming languages that I had worked on in the past. A few trivia based questions were asked (but I was very clear to the interviewer that I didnt know the answer to these kind of questions).
// Round 4 - Primarily a culture fit round. They just wanted to see where I would fit into their team.


// Lead level
// Implement chat like functionality in a ViewPager where first tab is sender and second tab is receiver (without making use of LiveData. They wanted the implementation using interfaces)

// GCD related Stringg Related and both were straight algorithm based

// 1) delete nodes from tree which is having only one child.
// 2) the array contains only 2 types of elements and are in sorted manner. find the array sum in O(logn)
