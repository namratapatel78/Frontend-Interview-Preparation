The most challenging work I led was the comprehensive redesign and modernization of the Scripbox web and mobile apps, where I managed a five-member frontend squad.


Situation:
At Scripbox, the business aimed to boost user engagement and satisfaction rapidly, but our frontend system was fragmented with technical debt, inconsistent code, and slow release cycles. The codebase was very old, we were using class components of react with flux. The code base was cluttered.

Task:
As the Senior Frontend Engineer leading a five-member squad, I needed to architect and deliver a scalable, maintainable frontend platform for both web and mobile, balancing speed, quality, and security.

Action:

Designed and led the creation of a reusable component library using ShadCN and Tailwind CSS, unifying UI across React and React Native apps.

Rolled out TypeScript and Redux Toolkit to streamline state management, improving development speed by 20%.

Piloted a git-submodules workflow that improved deployment efficiency by 25%, gaining stakeholder buy-in through a proof-of-concept.

Implemented performance optimizations including lazy loading, code-splitting, and image optimization, reducing page load times by 20%.

Built a hardened authentication library supporting Google OAuth, biometrics, and auto-token refresh, unifying security for web and mobile sign-in.

Hardened CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Lint-Staged hooks to improve code quality and reduce release lead time.

Enforced strict cross-browser QA and authored living technical documentation to accelerate onboarding and cross-team collaboration.

Result:
The project resulted in a 30% increase in user engagement, 20% higher user satisfaction, faster performance, and a secure, maintainable codebase—transforming both the product experience and team culture.
