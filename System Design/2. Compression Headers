In summary: Compression headers apply to both static and dynamic resources, not just static resources‚Äîprovided server configuration and the type of resource allow it

üîß What Are Compression Headers?
They are HTTP headers used by the client to request compressed content and by the server to respond with compressed data.

Compression reduces the size of assets like HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON ‚Äî speeding up delivery and reducing network usage.

üß≠ How It Works (Client ‚Üî Server)
1. Client Request
The client (usually a browser) includes the Accept-Encoding header:

GET /app.js HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept-Encoding: gzip, br
This tells the server:

‚ÄúI can handle compressed responses using gzip or brotli (br) ‚Äî send whichever you support.‚Äù

2. Server Response
If compression is enabled, the server checks Accept-Encoding, compresses the response, and includes the Content-Encoding header:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Encoding: br
Content-Type: application/javascript
Vary: Accept-Encoding
This tells the browser:

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the content, compressed with Brotli. Please decompress it before using.‚Äù

‚úÖ What the Headers Mean
Header	Direction	Purpose
Accept-Encoding	Client ‚Üí Server	Lists compression formats the client supports
Content-Encoding	Server ‚Üí Client	Indicates how the response was compressed
Vary	Server ‚Üí Client	Caches must vary response based on encoding used

üì¶ Compression Formats
Format	Pros	Support
Gzip	Fast, widely supported	~100%
Brotli	Better compression, slower	>95% (modern browsers)

üß™ Real Example
Request:

GET /main.css HTTP/1.1
Host: yourapp.com
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Server response (with Brotli):

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/css
Content-Encoding: br
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 7453
If the client didn‚Äôt send Accept-Encoding, server would send uncompressed:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/css
Content-Length: 23485
üöÄ How to Enable on Server
Nginx Example:
nginx
# Enable GZIP
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain application/json text/css application/javascript;

# Enable Brotli (requires module)
brotli on;
brotli_types text/plain application/json text/css application/javascript;
Node.js Express Example:
js
const express = require('express');
const compression = require('compression');
const app = express();

app.use(compression()); // uses gzip by default

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});
‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas
Don't compress binary formats like images (JPEG/PNG are already compressed).

Always set Vary: Accept-Encoding to prevent cache mismatches.

Brotli is better for static files (pre-compress with .br during build).


-----------

Compression like Gzip and Brotli is applied only to text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON) because they contain repetitive patterns that compress well, significantly reducing file size. Binary assets (images, videos, fonts) are already compressed using specialized algorithms, so recompressing them offers little to no benefit and wastes server CPU.
