// Web workers are a browser feature that allow JavaScript to run in background threads separate from the main execution thread. This means heavy computations or time-consuming tasks can be processed without freezing or slowing down the user interface. Communication with web workers happens via message passing (using methods like postMessage), and since they run in isolation, they donâ€™t have direct access to the DOM. This design helps keep web applications responsive while performing intensive tasks.
