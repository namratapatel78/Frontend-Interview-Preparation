- Use DOM-based rendering for cells rather than canvas for easier interaction and accessibility.
- Implement vertical and horizontal virtualization to render only visible rows and columns for performance (lazy loading on scroll).


DOM-based rendering
- Uses the Document Object Model (DOM) where each visual element (like a cell, button, or text) is an HTML element.
- uses HTML elements managed by the browser, excels in interactivity and accessibility but can be slower with many elements.

Canvas rendering
- Uses a single <canvas> element where graphics are drawn pixel-by-pixel via JavaScript drawing APIs.
- draws pixels directly in a bitmap for fast, complex graphics but requires manual handling of interactions and offers limited accessibility.
