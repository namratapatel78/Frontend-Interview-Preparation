1. Optimizing Initial Load Performance
  a. Asset Optimization
    Minification & Compression, Image Optimization
  b. Bundling & Code Splitting
  c. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)
  d. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) & Caching
    CDN: Serve static assets via CDNs to leverage geographic distribution, reducing latency.
    Caching: HTTP cache headers, and service workers
      HTTP cache headers: Cache Control: max-age:300, must-revalidate, Etag and Last Modified

2. Enhancing Runtime Performance
  a. Efficient Rendering & Repaints
    use techniques like virtual DOM diffing (in frameworks like React) to reduce unnecessary renders
  b. Optimizing Animations & Interactions
    Instead of setTimeout or setInterval, use requestAnimationFrame to ensure animations run in sync with the browser’s refresh rate
    Throttling & Debouncing: Apply these techniques to event handlers (e.g., scroll or resize events) to avoid overloading the main thread.
  c. Web Workers & Off-Main Thread Processing

3. Network Optimization
  a. Efficient Data Fetching
    Lazy Loading: Load images, videos, or non-critical components only when they’re needed. The Intersection Observer API can help trigger lazy loading.
    Preloading & Prefetching: Use <link rel="preload"> and <link rel="prefetch"> to instruct the browser about resources that will be needed soon.
  b. API Optimization
    Reduce Payloads: Use GraphQL endpoints that allow you to request only the necessary data.

4. Profiling, Debugging & Continuous Monitoring
  a. Performance Profiling Tools
    Chrome DevTools: Use the Performance tab to analyze the runtime behavior, monitor frame rates, and identify bottlenecks.
    Lighthouse: Run audits to get actionable insights on load performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.
    WebPageTest: Test your page performance under different network conditions and geographies.

6. Advanced Techniques
  a. Memory Management
    Prevent Memory Leaks:
    Regularly profile memory usage and address leaks in event listeners, timers, or detached DOM nodes.
    Efficient Data Structures:
    Optimize data handling to reduce memory footprint, especially in complex applications with heavy state management.
  b. Progressive Rendering
    Skeleton Screens & Placeholders: Instead of spinners, use skeleton screens to give users a sense of progress during content loading.
    Progressive Enhancement: Ensure the core functionality is accessible even if all assets haven’t loaded, then enhance the UI progressively.
  c. Third-Party Script Management
    Audit Third-Party Code:
    Regularly assess the impact of external libraries and scripts. Lazy load or asynchronously load these scripts to mitigate their impact on performance.
