// Service workers are scripts that run in the background, independent of any web page, enabling features like offline functionality, background sync, and push notifications. They intercept network requests and allow you to define custom caching strategies, which is a key technology behind Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Essentially, they help deliver a more resilient and faster user experience by managing network traffic and caching assets, even when the user is offline.
