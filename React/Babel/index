Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a 
backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers.

The new browsers does not support ES6+

- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)

Babel can convert JSX syntax using React preset (@babel/preset-react)
Babel can convert Typescript syntax using typescript preset (@babel/preset-typescript)

Plugins run before Presets.
Plugin ordering is first to last.
Preset ordering is reversed (last to first).
