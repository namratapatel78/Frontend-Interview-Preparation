If you're starting a new React web project in 2025 and want to use modern tools, follow best practices, and ensure it's performance-optimized, here's a high-level stack with the best current tools:

🧱 1. Project Scaffold / Build Tool
✅ Vite
Why: Lightning-fast dev server, optimized build with Rollup, native ES modules.

Features: Instant HMR, smart pre-bundling, plugin ecosystem.

Alternative: Next.js (for SSR/SSG and full-stack features, but heavier).

⚛️ 2. React Setup
React 18+ with automatic batching and concurrent features.

Enable strict mode and React Profiler in dev.

📦 3. Package Manager
✅ pnpm
Faster, more disk-efficient than npm or yarn.

Handles monorepos easily (if needed later).

💨 4. Styling
✅ Tailwind CSS
Utility-first, highly composable, JIT compiled.

Works great with component libraries and design systems.

Optional: Add daisyUI, shadcn/ui, or Radix UI for accessible components.
📁 5. Routing
✅ react-router-dom v6+
Declarative and file-based routing patterns supported.

If using Next.js, routing is built-in.

⚙️ 6. State Management
✅ Zustand
Minimal, scalable global state.

Supports React devtools and async actions.

Alternatives:
Jotai (atomic model),

Redux Toolkit (if working on enterprise-scale).

🔍 7. Data Fetching & Caching
✅ React Query (TanStack Query)
Great for server state: caching, syncing, pagination, mutations.

SSR/SSG supported, devtools included.

🧪 8. Testing
Unit Testing: Vitest (works perfectly with Vite).

Component Testing: Testing Library

E2E Testing: Playwright or Cypress

📊 9. Performance Tools
Lighthouse CI: For audits (accessibility, SEO, PWA, etc.)

React Profiler

Use code splitting + lazy() + Suspense

Enable tree-shaking, minification (Terser/ESBuild via Vite)

🧰 10. Utilities
ESLint + eslint-config-airbnb / eslint-config-universe

Prettier: Code formatter

Husky + lint-staged: Pre-commit hooks

TypeScript (default now for most setups)

Alias imports: Configure in tsconfig.json and Vite (@/components, etc.)

🧑‍🚀 Bonus: DX Tools
Storybook (component preview/documentation)

Plop (generators for boilerplate)

Bundlephobia or vite-plugin-bundle-visualizer (see bundle size)

⚡ Final Setup (Suggested Stack)
bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm create vite my-app --template react-ts
cd my-app
pnpm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
# Add eslint, prettier, zustand, react-query, etc.
