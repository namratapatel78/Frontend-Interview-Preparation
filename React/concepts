React is a JS library for building fast and interactive user interfaces.
Developed by facebook in 2011
Components are the building blocks of an React application
main component called App
Tree like component hierarchy
Give example of any application
Used for design views and rest is upto us like which library we have to use (gives you absolute control)

Famous apps written in React (Facebook, Netflix, Instagram, Prime video, Twitter)

With React we can design both SPA and MPA but mostly used for SPA

Angular is a framework and it comes with out of the box solution routing, handling network request etc.
So we don't have control at that level.

class in JS
className in JSX

var Checkbox = React.createClass({
getInitialState(): function() {
return {checked: true}
}

render: function () {

}
});

properties - props
