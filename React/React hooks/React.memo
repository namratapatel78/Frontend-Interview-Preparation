Since React.memo() is a higher-order component, it can wrap itself around regular 
React functional components.
When React components are wrapped with React.memo(), React renders the component and memoizes the result.
If the componentâ€™s props are the same before the next render, React re-uses the memoized result. 
By doing this, the re-render is skipped and React does not update the DOM, 
thus achieving this performance boost. 
The same functionality can be achieved in class components by PureComponent
