- Nested routes
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

// Functional components

- A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
- Also known as Stateless components as they simply accept data and display them in some form, they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.
- React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount) cannot be used in functional components.

// Class based components

- A class component requires you to extend from React.Component
  and create a render function which returns a React element.
- Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.
- React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, componentDidMount).
