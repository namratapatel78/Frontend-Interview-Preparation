1. Virtual DOM vs React Fiber

React Fiber is the reconciliation and rendering engine introduced in React 16.
It’s a complete rewrite of React's core algorithm with a focus on performance, flexibility, and user experience.

Fiber enables React to break rendering work into units and pause, resume, or abort work as needed — making it suitable for building responsive UIs.

Unlike the old call-stack recursion, Fiber uses a linked tree to enable pausing/resuming.
