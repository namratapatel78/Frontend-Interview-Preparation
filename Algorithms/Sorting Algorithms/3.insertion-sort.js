// Time - O(n2), Space - O(1)
// Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by picking each element and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array. Itâ€™s similar to the way you might sort playing cards in your hand.

// Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left portion which is always sorted.

const insertionSort = (arr) => {
  for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let currentValue = arr[i];
    for (var j = i-1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentValue; j--) {
      arr[j+1] = arr[j];
    }
    arr[j+1] = currentValue;
    console.log(arr);
  }
  return arr;
};

//                           i
console.log(insertionSort([2,1,9,76,4]));
//                         j
