// Big O is the worst-case scenario growth curve for the complexity of an algorithm.
// Big O notation comes two-fold: Time Complexity and Space Complexity.
// usually thereâ€™s a trade-off between saving time and saving space

// Big O Notation describes the execution time required or the spaced used by an algorithm.

// Algorithm is the step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.
// The bigger the problem, the longer you would expect your algorithm to take to solve the problem.

// Big O Notation is the mathematical expression of how long an algorithm takes to run depending 
// on how long is the input.
// In practice, we use Big O Notation to classify algorithms by how they respond to changes in input size, 
// so algorithms with the same growth rate are represented with the same Big O Notation.
// The letter O is used because the rate of growth of a function is also called order of the function.
