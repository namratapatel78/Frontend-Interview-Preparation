- BST Definition

Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which nodes that have lesser value are stored on the left while the nodes with a higher value are stored at the right.

The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. 
There must be no duplicate nodes.

A new key is always inserted at the leaf.
Any node whose left and right children are null is known as a leaf node in a binary tree.


- Min & Max height

Min height: min dist b/w root node to the node which does not have two child. It can be one child or no child
Max height: max dist b/w root node to the leaf node.


- Balanced Tree

If tree is balanced then the diff b/w max height and min height will be 1 at most. It can be 0 or 1.
min height >= max height - 1

When tree is balanced then searching is easier.

We can make a tree balanced itself automatically when we add or remove node.

- Tree traversal methods

in order - left subtree -> root -> right subtree (l root r)
pre order - explores root node first (root left right)
post order - explores root node before root node (l r root)
level order - breadth first search - explores the node level wise (0, 1, 2 ...)
