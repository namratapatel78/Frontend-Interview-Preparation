NPM vs Yarn vs PNPM

All three—npm, yarn, and pnpm—are package managers for JavaScript, but they have key differences in performance, efficiency, and features.

1. NPM (Node Package Manager)
Default package manager for Node.js
Comes bundled with Node.js
Uses a central node_modules directory, which can lead to duplication
Slower installations compared to Yarn and PNPM
Uses a lockfile (package-lock.json) for consistency
Has security features like npm audit
Pros:
✔ Comes pre-installed with Node.js
✔ Large community and support
✔ npx allows running packages without installation

Cons:
❌ Slower than Yarn & PNPM
❌ Can have performance issues due to duplicate dependencies

2. Yarn
Introduced by Facebook to fix NPM’s speed & security issues
Uses a more efficient caching system
Introduced yarn.lock for deterministic installs
Supports parallel package installations (faster than npm)
Plug’n’Play (PnP) mode removes node_modules for improved performance
Pros:
✔ Faster than npm due to caching
✔ Better dependency resolution
✔ PnP mode reduces disk usage

Cons:
❌ Heavier memory usage than PNPM
❌ Can be complex for beginners

3. PNPM (Performant NPM)
Most efficient in disk space usage
Uses a global store for packages, avoiding duplication
Faster than both npm & yarn due to hard links and symlinks
Creates a pnpm-lock.yaml file for deterministic installs
Works well with monorepos
Pros:
✔ Uses less disk space (no duplicate packages)
✔ Fastest installation due to symlinking
✔ Better handling of monorepos

Cons:
❌ Not as widely adopted as npm/yarn
❌ Requires some learning to understand symlinking

Which one should you use?
✅ Use npm if you want the default and simplest solution.
✅ Use yarn if you need faster installs & better dependency management.
✅ Use pnpm if you want the most efficient, fast, and disk-friendly solution (especially for monorepos).
