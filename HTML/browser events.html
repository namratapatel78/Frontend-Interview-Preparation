<!-- DOMContentLoaded, load, beforeunload, unload -->

<!-- document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ready); -->


The lifecycle of an HTML page has three important events:

DOMContentLoaded – the browser fully loaded HTML, and the DOM tree is built, but external resources like pictures <img> and stylesheets may not yet have loaded.
load – not only HTML is loaded, but also all the external resources: images, styles etc.
beforeunload/unload – the user is leaving the page.
