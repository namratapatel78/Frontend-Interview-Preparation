<!-- Parsing is done by the browser

<script> - will block the parsing of HTML page while fetching/downloading and executing the script.

<script async> - Blocks the HTML parsing only while executing script.
use this for scripts which are not dependent on other scripts i.e. Analytics
Scripts gets executed in the random order.

<script defer> - Fetch/Downloads the script while HTML parsing and executes it after parsing is done
Executes the script before DOM is loaded. If the script relies upon or is relied upon by another script then use defer.
Scripts gets executed in the order appeared in document .

Because of the blocking nature of <script> we use to keep scripts tag in the end of the <body>.
But with async and differ, we don't need to do that. -->
