// Js is dynamically typed language.
// Type checking will be done at runtime
// Type error will occur at runtime

// JS is single threaded & synchronous execution => One call stack =>  Only one task can be executed at a time.

// asynchronous means more than one at a time

// Static typing
// Type error will occur at compile time

// Js has weak typing - no need to specify the type of variable. it will set the type according to the value

// Js is non-blocking - doesn't waits for anything

// JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in an internet browser.

// Dynamic, Static, Strong, Weak typing


// Strong typing - need to specify the type of variable and it is checked at the compile time.
