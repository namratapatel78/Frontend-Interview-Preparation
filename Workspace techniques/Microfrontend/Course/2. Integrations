Major categories of integration

1. Build time integration

  How it works:
    - Before container app gets loaded in the browser, it gets access to remote app source code

  Pro:
    - Easy to setup and understand

  Cons:
    - Container app has to be deployed every time remote app is updated

2. Run time integration

  How it works:
    - After container app gets loaded in the browser, it gets access to remote app source code
    - remote app code gets deployed to https://my-app.com/<remote-name>.js
    - User navigates to my-app.com, container app is loaded
    - Container app fetches <remote-app>.js and executes it.

  Pro:
    - Remote apps can be deployed independently at any time
    - Different versions of remote app can be deployed and container app can decide which one to use

  Cons:
    - Setup is complicated


3. Server integration
